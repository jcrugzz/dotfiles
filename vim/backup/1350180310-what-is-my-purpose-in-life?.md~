Now this is a question I have asked myself a multitude of times, with each
answer directing me down the path I have chosen. I find it to be the most
important question you can ask yourself.

### Why?

I have a theory that most people in society go through their lives without
asking themselves this crucial question. This question is what allows you to
understand who you are and what you want to do. Yet most wander through the days without
even knowing themselves on a deeper level, distracted by all of the noise
created in society.

### The Problem

This is both the easiest and the most difficult to encapsulate. The problem is
the pattern that has developed over the years to keep Gen Y's brain's in the
state of a high schooler.

The interesting part about this is that it is the opportune age to keep the mind
at. It is the time where everyone is consumed by the popularity contest that is
high school and is otherwise distracted by their own insecurities. These simple
ideas that consume the life of a high schooler reduce the time one takes to
actually look within oneself.

#### The effect of drugs on children

It is interesting as I watch this Generation RX documentary how well prescribed
drugs are correlated to school shootings. It makes real good sense that the
illumniati would use drugs in order to chemically control the brains of kids.
Killing their creative thought and access to real consciousness.

The phrase, stay a kid as long as you can.
